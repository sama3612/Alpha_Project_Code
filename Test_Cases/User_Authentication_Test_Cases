User Authentication

We tested to make sure each of the following cases was working functionally when testing the user authentication page:
- create new user
- login with correct username/password
- create new user errors:
  - error when using an email that has already been taken
  - error when passwords don't match when creating new user credentials
  - error when passwords don't satisfy all the necessary criteria
- error when logging in with an email that doesn't exist
- error when logging in with password that doesn't match
- error when one or more fields are empty

Test Case:  Add new friend.

Result:  New friends were able to be added when logged in as every current user in the user table.  If a second friend is added without navigating back to the friends page,
         the page will fail and the second friend will not be added.  In further iteration, we need to investigate the issue and determine how to add multiple friends from 
	 the addFriends page without navigating to another page in between adds.  Additionally, we should work to implement some kind of success/error message so that the user
	 can more easily determine if they were successful in adding a new friend.
 
Output:  None if only one friend is added in a row.  After a second or third add friend without navigating to another page and back: "Cannot POST /addFriends/addFriends/add".

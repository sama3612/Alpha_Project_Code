Test Case:  Adding friends to backend database directly.

Result:  Success.  When a friend is added to a user's friend array in the backend database directly, the friend page is updated on the
	 next page load to include the new friend.  There is not any output to this test, because we were manipulating the backend database
	 directly, and there is no output from the app.

Output:  None.

Here is a pretty much blank file for Sai. Here is where I will be doing my initial project commits.


Commit1:

Modeled the webpage heirarchy after the Lab7 that we completed.
Based off of Jeff's code, I created the ejs files that are easier to extend to other pages

Important notes for cloning this repo:
- I have node already installed on my computer, and the only node package that I did not have
    installed was 'Express'
    - To install this package, I simply typed into my terminal: npm install Express
    - If there are other packages that are throwing errors when trying to run 'node server.js',
        install those packages and try running the command again.
